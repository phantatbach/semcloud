This package is not autonomous: it is designed to support a specific section of a pipeline,
meaning that it takes as input output from
the [`semasioFlow`](https://montesmariana.github.io/semasioFlow) Python package^[A similar vignette for the Python steps can be found [here](https://montesmariana.github.io/semasioFlow/tutorials/createClouds.html).]
and prepares the data to be used in [NephoVis](https://qlvl.github.io/NephoVis) and the [Level3 ShinyApp](https://github.com/montesmariana/Level3).
This vignette will show the procedure to prepare data for NephoVis, whereas `vignette('HDBSCAN')`
will go through the HDBSCAN clustering for Level3 and the classification of clouds.

First, next to `semcloud` itself, we will load some packages of the `tidyverse` and `cluster`.

```{r libraries}
library(semcloud)
library(readr)
library(dplyr)
library(purrr)
library(tibble)
library(cluster) # to compute medoids
library(rjson) # to store json files

# Do not show column types when loading dataframes:
options(readr.show_col_types = FALSE)
```

Then we want to set up the most important paths, which may or may not be in the same directory. By default, the [`semasioFlow` workflow](https://montesmariana.github.io/semasioFlow/tutorials/createClouds.html) will store the distance matrices in an `output` directory with a `tokens` subdirectory for token-level matrices and a `cws` directory for type-level matrices. These are going to be the **input** for this processing.
On the other hand, `semasioFlow` stores registers (frequency data of the context words,
parameter settings of the different models and lists of context words per token)
in a `nephovis` directory, which you can use to feed data to [NephoVis](https://github.com/qlvl/nephovis). This is going to be our **output** directory.
Each of these will have subdirectories for the different lemmas or concepts you might be working on, even if you only have one.
For a semasiological workflow [e.g. @montes_2021] you will use
lemmas, whereas an onomasiological workflow [e.g. @montes.etal_2021] you will use concepts; the only
difference is that the latter combines different variants per model. Any mention of lemmas
in this vignette can be substituted for *concept* in the onomasiological workflow.

First we will look at the different steps when working with one lemma and then sum up with
a loop over multiple lemmas.

# Single lemma workflow

```{r directory}
# based on the directory structure resulting from the Python workflow
lemma <- 'name_of_lemma'
base_dir <- "path/to/data" # shared path
input_dir <- file.path(base_dir, "output", "tokens", lemma) # where the data is stored
cw_dir <- file.path(base_dir, "output", "cws", lemma)
output_dir <- file.path(base_dir, "nephovis", lemma) # where the data will go
```

## Token coordinates

The first step is to go through the token-level distance matrices and apply dimensionality reduction to obtain only two coordinates for visualization. For that purpose we need to decide which methods we are interested in (in case we want to compare them). The options are:

- `'mds'`: nonmetric multidimensional scaling (ran with `vegan::metaMDS()`)

- `'tsne'`: t-stochastic neighbor embedding (ran with `Rtsne::Rtsne()`), with different perplexities indicated by appending a number to the label, e.g. `'tsne20'`, `'tsne30'`...

- `'umap'`: uniform manifold approximation and projection (ran with `umap::umap()`).

For each technique, we obtain a different solution, which results in a tab-separated file with
one row per token, a column with IDs and two columns per model: the x and the y coordinates.
A named list as shown below will inform the code of which techniques to use (the names in the list) and which infixes to use in the file names.

```{r, solutionsOld}
# This list works for a loop in the function below and should then be stored as a json file
# in the github directory of each lemma, to tell the visualization what is being used
solutions_old <- list("mds" = ".mds")
for (perp in c(10, 20, 30, 50)) {
    solutions_old[[paste0("tsne", perp)]] = paste0(".tsne.", perp)
}
solutions_old
```

For example, the code line below will only run `Rtsne::Rtsne()` with perplexity 30 and store the coordinates in a file called `'name_of_lemma.tsne.30.tsv'`.
This list must also be stored, to inform NephoVis of the available visualization options and how to find their data.

```{r, solutions}
solutions <- list("tsne30" = ".tsne.30")
write(rjson::toJSON(solutions), file.path(output_dir, paste0(lemma, ".solutions.json")))
```

We also need a list of filenames to obtain the distances from, which we could either read by
filtering the contents of our `output_dir` or by appending the file extension to the names of the models in our register.


```{r, fileslist}
suffix <- ".ttmx.dist.pac"
models_file <- file.path(output_dir, paste0(lemma, '.models.tsv'))
files_list <- paste0(read_tsv(models_file)$`_model`, suffix)
```

The `getClouds()` function groups the full "workflow":

1. It sets up one empty dataframe per item in `solutions`, which will be filled in with coordinates and stored in a `'[lemma].[solution].tsv'` file.

2. For each file in `files_list`:

    2.1 It extracts the model name

    2.2 It loads the file with `tokensFromPac()`
    
    2.3 If `logrank = TRUE` (the default), it applies the transformation; if `logdist = TRUE` it also *computes* euclidean distances on the log-transformed values instead of just making them symmetric. The clouds in [*Cloudspotting*](https://cloudspotting.marianamontes.me) were generated with `logrank = TRUE, logdist = FALSE`.
    
    2.4 It applies the corresponding algorithm and extracts the coordinates
    
    2.5 It appends the coordinates as columns preceded by the name of the model to the corresponding dataframe: `'[modelname].x'`; `'[modelname].y'`.
   
In addition, if "mds" is one of the algorithms,
it will *return* a list with the stress values.

```{r, getCloud}
getClouds(input_dir, output_dir, files_list, lemma, solutions)
```

Then you can read your files with `readr::read_tsv()`.

```{r, readCloud, eval=FALSE}
read_tsv(file.path(output_dir, paste0(lemma, ".tsne.30.tsv")))
```

## Context words coordinates

For the context words, the workflow is exactly the same as for the tokens. The difference is that the files are saved as `'.csv'` (because for some reason R cannot read them when they are `.wwmx...pac`) and so it uses the `focdistsFromCsv()` function. This is indicated by specifying `type = "focdists"`.

```{r getClouds2, message=FALSE, results='hide'}
suffix <- ".wwmx.dist.csv"
files_list <- paste0(read_tsv(models_file)$`_model`, suffix)

getClouds(cw_dir, output_dir, files_list, lemma, solutions, type = "focdists")
```

## Model distances and coordinates

The files created by `getClouds()` take care of the visualization in Levels 2 and 3 of NephoVis. For the Level 1 plot, as well as the distance matrix in Level 2 and the selection of medoids, we first need to obtain distances between the models.
For that purpose, `compLemma()` loads the `'[lemma].models.tsv'` file in the `output_dir` in order to modify it by appending the coordinates from `vegan::metaMDS()` on the distances between the models. By default, it will compute "euclidean" distances on the transformed matrices (see `eucliMats()`), but the function can be changed with the `fun` argument, and the transformation can be turned off with the `transformed` argument. It returns some data for a register, which I tend to combine across lemmas and store as `euclidean_register.tsv` to tell the index of the visualization which lemmas to offer.

Under the hood, it also stores the distance matrix as `[lemma].models.dist.tsv`. If the file already exists, it loads it instead of recomputing the distances. This distance matrix is then used in Level 2 of NephoVis.

```{r, modelsdist}
reg <- compLemma(lemma, input_dir, output_dir)
```

## Medoids

The medoids are simply calculated with `cluster::pam()` and some basic information is stored in a `[lemma].medoids.tsv` file. The only important column for the visualization is `medoids`, which is what NephoVis reads to automatically select the right models.

```{r pam}
k <- 8 # number of medoids you want

distmtx <- read_tsv(file.path(output_dir, paste0(lemma, ".models.dist.tsv"))) %>% 
  matricizeCloud() %>% as.dist()
pam_data <- pam(distmtx, k = k)
medoid_data <- pam_data$clusinfo %>%
  as_tibble() %>%
  mutate(medoid = pam_data$medoids, medoid_i = seq(k)) # medoid in singular or NephoVis would not be able to read it

write_tsv(medoid_data, file.path(output_dir, paste0(lemma, ".medoids.tsv")))
```

We can also add the clustering information to the models register.

```{r pam2}
models_file <- file.path(output_dir, paste0(lemma, ".models.tsv"))
read_tsv(models_file) %>% 
    mutate(
        pam_cluster = pam_data$clustering[`_model`], # add pam-cluster number
        medoid = pam_data$medoids[pam_cluster] # add name of medoid
    ) %>% 
    write_tsv(models_file)
```

## Further steps

The visualization can also take advantage of tailored contexts for the different models;
the code to obtain these columns, based on the output of [`semasioFlow.contextwords.listContextwords()`](https://montesmariana.github.io/semasioFlow/semasioFlow.contextwords.html#semasioFlow.contextwords.listContextwords) and the data in `'[lemma].variables.tsv'`, is described in `vignette('weightConcordance')`.

In addition, HDBSCAN clustering and classification of the clusters is covered in `vignette('HDBSCAN')`.

# Loops across multiple lemmas

Below is some code to run the workflow above across multiple lemmas.

```{r looping, eval = FALSE}
lemmas <- c('lemma1', 'lemma2', 'lemma3') #or whatever they are
base_dir <- '/path/to/data'
input_dir <- file.path(base_dir, "output", "tokens") # where the data is stored
cw_dir <- file.path(base_dir, "output", "cws")
output_dir <- file.path(base_dir, "nephovis") # where the data will go
solutions <- list("tsne30" = ".tsne.30")

suffix <- ".ttmx.dist.pac"
for (lemma in lemmas) {

  files_list <- paste0(read_tsv(models_file)$`_model`, suffix)
  write(toJSON(solutions), file.path(output_dir, lemma, paste0(lemma, ".solutions.json")))
  getClouds(file.path(input_dir, lemma), file.path(output_dir, lemma), files_list, lemma, solutions)
}

  getClouds(file.path(cw_dir, lemma), file.path(output_dir, lemma), files_list, lemma, solutions,
            type = 'focdists')
}

# Distances between models ----
reg <- map_dfr(lemmas, ~compLemma(.x, file.path(input_dir, .x), file.path(output_dir, .x)))
write_tsv(reg, file.path(output_dir, "euclidean_register.tsv"))

  pam_data <- pam(distmtx, k = k)
  medoid_data <- pam_data$clusinfo %>%
    as_tibble() %>%
    mutate(medoids = pam_data$medoids, medoid_i = seq(k))
  
  write_tsv(medoid_data, file.path(output_dir, lemma, paste0(lemma, ".medoids.tsv")))
  
  models_file <- file.path(output_dir, lemma, paste0(lemma, ".models.tsv"))
  read_tsv(models_file) %>%
    mutate(
      pam_cluster = pam_data$clustering[`_model`], # add pam-cluster number
      medoid = pam_data$medoids[pam_cluster] # add name of medoid
      ) %>%
    write_tsv(models_file)
}
```
